# GuidedTour Test app

This is a simple playground for the GuidedTour library.

Edit the GuidedTour steps in `app.component.ts` to test different configurations.

## Important

You must first build the library in order to build and run this app.

Run the shorthand command `npm run start` which does the following:

1. Run `ng build guided-tour`.
2. Run `ng serve guided-tour-test-app`.
